# Context_Aware_Chatbot
This project involves building a conversational chatbot that can maintain awareness of past interactions and respond coherently across multiple conversation turns. The chatbot primarily uses existing large language models such as Gemini for response generation and includes fallback support using locally hosted models via Ollama2.
